# Lab 1 - Masking for Dev/Test Environments  <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING -->

## Scenario
One of the first steps of the modernization process is to deploy a test/dev environment on AWS for the application team to make changes to the application and test those changes in the new cloud infrastructure. Since it’s still early in the process, you are not allowed to use data with any sensitive values in the test/dev database. So, you decide to use Baffle’s static masking feature to anonymize sensitive data into the new PostgreSQL database as you move the data so that you can do both in one workflow.

## Goals for this lab
After completing this lab, you will have a PostgresSQL database with a statically masked dataset created from a cleartext dataset. You will be able to verify that the demo application can work directly against masked database and see only masked values for sensitive data fields.

## Brief overview of submodule one.

- Verify installation

- Enable masking polices

- Trigger DMS job to perform initial masking of data

- Verify the sample application works with masked data

- Add new data to production database and verify that new data is automatically transferred and masked in test/dev database
