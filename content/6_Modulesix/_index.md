# CONCLUSION  

CONGRATULATIONS! You’ve successfully completed the Enable enterprise Grade  
Data Security for PostgreSQL with Baffle workshop and helped your  
hypothetical company implement the data security measures needed to ensure a  
secure and compliant modernization onto AWS infrastructure.  

In this workshop you were able to leverage Baffle to:  
- Anonymize data using static data masking to create a test/dev dataset  
- Enable encryption and dynamic access control to ensure least privileged  
access to sensitive data that blocks even DBAs  
- Provide cryptographically enforced isolation of data from multiple tenants  
even when the data in commingled in a single table  
- View the enforced data protection policies for each security control to provide  
evidence in security audits that your data access controls are in place  

For more information on how Baffle’s data protection solution can help your  
company securely migrate and modernize your applications to use AWS, please
