title: "Lab 3 - Multi-tenant Data Isolation"
chapter: true

## Scenario
You receive an urgent request from the Institutional Clients department that a very important European client has requested assurances that their data is securely isolated from all other clients and that they have the option to remove their data from your systems at any time. While it’s possible to set up an entirely parallel application and database infrastructure for this client, it’s a costly and unscalable solution given that you foresee other large clients making the same request. Instead, you decide to address this requirement by using Baffle’s multi-tenant encryption capabilities to give the client cryptographically enforced isolation of their own data. compliance requirements.

## Goals for this lab
After completing this lab, you will have at least one tenant created with its encrypted using the tenant key. You will be able to validate that all data is visible in the demo application when keys are available. You will also be able to show that disabling access to the tenant key will make all data for that tenant inaccessible while data for other tenantas are unaffected. Lastly, you will be able to validate that database administrators   have no access to any sensitive data.

## Brief overview of submodule one.

- Verify installation

- Enroll new tenants and assign keys

- Define data protection policies for application tables

- Add tenant data and verify encryption and tenant-access

- Verify DBA does not have access to sensitive data value

- Disable tenant key and verify complete loss of access to data
