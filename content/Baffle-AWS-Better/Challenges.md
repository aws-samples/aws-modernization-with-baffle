# Data Security Challenges in AWS

-   Regulations: Meeting compliance requirements like GDPR, NIST, CCPA, and PCI-DSS demands control and least privilege access to sensitive data in AWS.
    
-   Application Encryption:
    

-   Traditional application-level encryption requires complex code changes for existing applications, making it costly and time-consuming.
    
-   Third-party applications often can't be modified at all.
    
-   Data Masking for Testing:
    
-   Lower environments need production-like data for testing, but sensitive data requires obfuscation to prevent security risks.
    
-   DBA Access Control:
    
-   DBAs often have full access to all data, violating least privilege principles.
    
-   Need a way to restrict DBA access while maintaining functionality.
    
-   Least Privilege for End Users:
    
-   Users need access only to specific data based on their roles.
    
-   Example: HR needs full social security numbers for benefits, while Support only needs the last 4 digits for identification.
    
-   SaaS/Multi-Tenant Security:
    
-   Need to isolate data in multi-tenant environments.
    
-   Each tenant should control their encryption keys and have the ability to "shred" their data by revoking access.
